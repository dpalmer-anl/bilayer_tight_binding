Package directory for bilayer tight binding model
Contains data sets, fits, and externally usable model

Directory structure
    workflow/ - Contains example files for conducting SCF and Wannierization calculations         
    datasets/ - Contains raw datasets for single- and bi-layer graphene as HDF files from the SCF/Wannierization calculations            
    bilayer_tight_binding/ - Main code
        model.py     - Model for inter- and intra-layer hoppings
        helper.py    - Helper functions for ease-of-use
        descriptors/ - Descriptors used in the model fitting    
        fits/        - Fitting scripts and results from fitting to data in datasets
        api.py       - User-facing functions
    examples/ - Simple examples using our model to generate band structures

To install the model for use externally, use 
    pip install .

Then import the model as 
    from bilayer_tight_binding.api import tb_model
